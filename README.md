# Relational Database Design
This project aims to create an efficient and well-structured relational database design using best practices in normalization and data organization. The design can serve as a foundation for developing applications requiring consistent and integrated data storage.

## Key Features

- **Normalization:** Applying normalization principles up to the third normal form (3NF) to eliminate data redundancy and ensure data integrity.
- **ER Diagram:** Providing a clear and detailed Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram to illustrate the relationships between tables and entities.
- **Referential Integrity:** Using foreign keys to ensure referential integrity between tables.
- **Scalability:** A flexible and extendable design to support the addition of entities and attributes in the future.
- **Sample Data:** Including sample data for each table to facilitate understanding and testing.
## Project Structure

1. **README.md:** Complete guide and documentation for this project.
2. **ERD Diagram:** ER diagram files in .png and .pdf formats.
3. **SQL Scripts:** SQL scripts for creating tables and inserting sample data.
4. **Documentation:** Documentation explaining each entity, attribute, and relationship in the database design.
